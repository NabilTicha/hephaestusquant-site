      <h1>How we think about research.</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        These aren't aspirational statements. They're the rules we actually
        follow when doing research. We wrote them down so we'd stop arguing about process.

        <h3>Try to kill your own ideas</h3>
        <p>
          Research is designed to reject hypotheses. If you can't specify what evidence
          would make you abandon a thesis, you don't have a thesis — you have a belief.
          We look for disconfirming evidence before accepting anything.
        </p>

        <h3>The data is the argument</h3>
        <p>
          A good narrative explains nothing by itself. If the regression doesn't hold
          out-of-sample, the story behind it is irrelevant. We've discarded ideas that
          sounded compelling because the numbers didn't back them up. That's the process working.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle">
        <div class="principle-num">03</div>
        <h3>If it can't be reproduced, it didn't happen</h3>
        <p>
          Every result needs to be reproducible from the same inputs and methodology.
          This is why Kernel tracks pipeline configs with hashes — if someone else can't
          get the same output from the same input, we treat the original result as suspect.
        </p>

      <div class="principle">
        <div class="principle-num">04</div>
        <h3>Risk first, always</h3>
        <p>
          The first question about any strategy or signal is: what can go wrong?
          How does it behave in a drawdown? What happens when correlations spike?
          We'd rather miss a good trade than take a bad one. This is a deliberate bias
          and we're comfortable with the opportunity cost.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle">
        <div class="principle-num">05</div>
        <h3>Parameters are regime-dependent</h3>
        <p>
          A model calibrated on 2012–2019 low-vol data will blow up in a 2020-style event.
          We condition everything on detected regime state — exposure limits, rebalancing frequency,
          even which factors we trust. A single parameter set across all environments is a bug.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle">
        <div class="principle-num">06</div>
        <h3>Research ≠ deployment</h3>
        <p>
          A research finding that "factor X has historically generated alpha" is not the same as
          "we should allocate capital to factor X." The decision to deploy requires a separate
          evaluation: current regime, crowding, cost structure, personal risk tolerance.
          Research produces information. Deployment is a different process.
